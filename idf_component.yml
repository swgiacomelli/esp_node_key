version: "0.2.0"
name: node_key
summary: "Lightweight node identity key management, CSR, signing, and trust verification on ESP-IDF using mbedTLS."
description: |
  This component provides functionality for managing a node's identity key pair, generating CSRs, signing messages, and verifying signatures using mbedTLS on ESP-IDF. As of v0.2.0, public interfaces use DER for keys, CSRs, device certificates, and CA lists. It includes utilities for Base64 encoding/decoding of signatures. The component is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems.

  Key features:
  - Generate and store ECC key pairs (secp256r1) in DER
  - Export public keys in DER (SubjectPublicKeyInfo)
  - Create Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in DER
  - Sign messages and verify signatures (ECDSA + SHA-256); signatures are DER
  - Verify device certificate (DER) chains against a DER CA list
  - Base64 helpers for signatures

  This component is ideal for IoT devices that require secure identity management and communication.
